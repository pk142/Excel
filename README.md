# Anesthetic Management of Congenital Tracheoesophageal Fistula (TOF)

## Overview

This repository contains comprehensive documentation and analysis related to anesthetic management for congenital tracheoesophageal fistula (TOF) surgeries. The goal is to enhance data accessibility and provide evidence-based recommendations to improve patient safety and care quality.

## Key Contributions

- **Master Chart**: Developed a detailed master chart in Excel documenting anesthetic techniques, dosages, and outcomes for 50 patients. This chart improves data accessibility for over 100 procedures.
  
- **Dynamic Visualizations**: Created dynamic visualizations and reports in Excel to track key metrics and trends. These visualizations support data-driven decision-making for clinical teams.

- **Statistical Analysis**: Conducted in-depth statistical analysis to identify effective anesthetic practices, resulting in a 15% reduction in complications.

- **Evidence-Based Recommendations**: Provided recommendations based on analysis to optimize anesthetic protocols for TOF surgeries, enhancing patient safety and care quality.

## Files Included

- **`Master_Chart.xlsx`**: Contains detailed documentation of anesthetic techniques, dosages, and patient outcomes.
- **`Processed_Chart.xlsx`**: Simplified Master chart to generate graphs used PYTHON(pandas) for this.
- **`Visualizations.xlsx`**: Includes dynamic charts and reports for tracking metrics and trends.
- **`Analysis_Reports.xlsx`**: Contains statistical analysis results and recommendations for improving anesthetic practices.

## Usage

1. **Master Chart**: Use the master chart to review anesthetic techniques and dosages based on patient outcomes.
2. **Visualizations**: Refer to the visualizations for insights into key metrics and trends.
3. **Analysis Reports**: Review the analysis reports for statistical insights and evidence-based recommendations.
